The Centre for Computational Medicine (CCM) is a Core Facility within The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) Research Institute. Our mission is to provide the scientists and clinicians at SickKids with computational expertise, including high performance computing resources, bioinformatics analysis consulting, and software development. The CCM also acts as a collaboration nexus, working with both biological/medical and computational scientists at SickKids and the University of Toronto to identify appropriate collaborators.
